weathermap
==========

A simple map app for weather



This is a one page web application. You can hit the app by http://avagu.github.io/weathermap.

The source code is available at https://github.com/AvaGu/weathermap. Feel free to contact me ava.gu1990 at gmail.com if you had any questions about the project.

It is leveraging Google Maps Javascript API and Forecast API to query the weather data for an address you put in.

It is also using Bootstrap for the front end, but not too much.

For the animated weather icon, it is using Skycons which is designed for Forecast.
